```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code snippet is intended to sort a list of numbers using the `sort` function from `Data.List`.  However, there is a subtle issue if `numbers` contains elements of different types, which would cause a type error and prevent compilation.
